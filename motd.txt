The Sausage world feels different! We have transfered our bodies to a new universe with more chances from the sausage gods! The constructors have been working hard to shape some of this land to your needs! The constructors have also carved out a lounge to the more needed people granted by our sausage god. We have started with some snow which might make us chilly so make warmth with others. The sausage gods have not found any repuirements for anything to help but we have to make use of our stuff! The constuctors have found metal to constuct a small area to welcome new players!
