The trees have started to blossem! The easter saunsage has hopped its way off to the limited cosmetic stand! (PLEASE keep in mind that the stand is buggy you will have to restartyour game to see if you have accses to some of the cosmetics) You can fit into the mood by picking up some spring cosmetics! Sadlly the moon map is under construction due to the lack of oxegen. (whoops(is that how you spell oxegen?)) The sausages can move faster then the average gorilla now maxing out at 15m per second (funny run you will see) there are some lighting issues in mountains but it will be fixed next update slipery physics eddited and more! - MeNiceVR
