I have some very bad news. I quit developing sausage sliders. recently my computer has been boot looping and the only way I could fix it was to factory reset it. Soon the servers will be shutdown and the game will be unplayable. i will plan a date for its shutdown. i will make another game after it though but if you really want the game back ill consider it https://discord.gg/wnsv86G65r for info about an other upcoming game soon play while you can until its shutdown R.I.P.
